# ContagionSim
Shows and demonstrates the abilities of different Contagions

Whats intresting is when the properties are tweaked just right you can observe the behaviors of an outbreak.

**Built in Behaviors:**
Blue = Innocent/Helathy and clear
Green = Infected/Contagious
Dead = Gray
Orange= Immune/Had virus and gained immunity to it


Simulation starts off with a tweakable number of infected (default 1) and as it collides with other particles it has a chance of passing the contagion on (default 75%) once a particle has been infected with the contagion there is a countdown for it to either gain immunity or die (default values death: 10% immunity: 90% Note: very high death percentage). After a certain period of time (Immunity countdown/2) the immunity is worn off and the particle goes back to normal.

**Observations:**
The immunity actually creates a wave like spread of the virus and suprisengly the virus usally dies off after it infects everyone even if they lose their immunity. Whats intresting though is this actually shows the properties of quarentine because this whole chain could be disrupted if a random amount of particles from the simulation go into a new one. Another thing to note is around 10% off the population end up dead showing that the contagion spread throughout mostly the whole population due to the 10% of dying from it.

**Notes:**
The contagion simulation is a proof of conept that I found cool. Its not very accurate and humans have much more complex traversal properties (buses, schools, plane) that can increase or decrease the spread. I still found it intresting though that it maintained some properties of an actually Virus. Feel free to take the repo and change it around as you like I think it works nicely as a template for social/diease intercations between people.
